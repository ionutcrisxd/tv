            <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>Your privacy is an important factor that Pinstripe considers in the development of our software and services. We are committed to being transparent and open. This Privacy Policy explains how we receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.</p>
            <p>Generally, we try to collect as little information as possible.</p>

            <h5>What do we mean by 'personal information'?</h5>
            <p>For us, 'personal information' means information which identifies you, like your name or email address. Any information that falls outside of this is 'non-personal information'.</p>
            <p>If we store your personal information with other information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.</p>

            <h5>What personal information do we collection about you?</h5>
            <p><strong>(a) through use of NextPVR applications:</strong> We collect no personal information about application usage.</p>

            <p><strong>(b) through registering an account on the NextPVR forums:</strong> If you register to join the forums, a profile is created that contains your email address, timezone and location. The timezone information is used to ensure post times are shown correctly for your location. The location is used to help us know what tv standards are used in your part of the world.</p>
            
            <p><strong>(c) through use of NextPVR forums and website:</strong> The forums software will collect information you supply, such as descriptions of problems, and log files. We use this information to help us provide support and improve our software and services for you. Your use of the web site will generate standard web logs, indicating resources used by your browser. The NextPVR web site uses Google Analytics, which gives us general information about the number of people who visit our website, and geographically where they come from.</p>

            <h5>When do we share your information with others?</h5>  
            <p>The only situation in which we would supply information to another party is when the law requires it. To date, this has never happened, and we do not anticipate it happening in the future. The majority of the information we collect is already almost entirely anonymous and never shows unique user behavior, except in voluntarily submitted logs on our forum.</p>

            <h5>What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?</h5>
            <p>We may need to change this policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update on NextPVR's forum.</p>
